                    <h2>Getting Started as a Web Developer</h2>
                    <p>The web is everywhere â€” powering social networks, online stores, and the apps we use daily...</p>
                    <div class="hidden">
                        <p>Becoming a web developer allows you to create these experiences. Web development has two main
                            parts:
                            front-end (what users see) and back-end (the server and database).</p>
                        <p>To get started, you should learn the basics: HTML for structure, CSS for design, and
                            JavaScript for
                            interactivity. Once youâ€™re comfortable, explore frameworks and tools that make development
                            faster
                            and easier. Most importantly, practice by building projects, no matter how small.</p>
                        <p>Consistency and patience are key. Start small, improve gradually, and youâ€™ll be amazed at how
                            far you
                            can go in just a few months.</p>

                    <h2>How to Build Responsive Websites</h2>
                    <p>A responsive website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). This is crucial
                        because
                        most people now browse the web on their phones...</p>
                    <div class="hidden">
                        <p>Here are some key steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use flexible grid layouts with CSS Grid or Flexbox.</li>
                            <li>Set images and videos to <code>max-width: 100%</code> so they resize automatically.</li>
                            <li>Apply media queries (e.g., <code>@media (max-width: 768px)</code>) to adjust styles for
                                smaller
                                screens.</li>
                            <li>Test your website on different devices and browsers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By mastering responsiveness, you ensure your websites are user-friendly and professional

                    <h2>How bitcoin will explode if Fed cut rate today</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoin is on the last support zone for it to bounce back</p>
                    <div class="hidden">
                        <p>If the Fed cuts rates today, bitcoin could see a significant price increase. Historically,
                            rate cuts
                            have led to increased liquidity in the market, which often benefits risk assets like
                            bitcoin.

                            Currently, bitcoin is hovering around a critical support level. If it holds this zone and
                            the Fed
                            announces a rate cut, we could see a strong bullish reaction as investors seek alternative
                            stores of
                            value.

                            However, if the support fails, we might see further downside before any potential recovery.
                            Keep an
                            eye on both the Fed's decision and bitcoin's price action in the coming days.</p>
